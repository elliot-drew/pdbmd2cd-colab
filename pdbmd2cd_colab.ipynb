        "The original webserver version of this program is available here: https://pdbmd2cd.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/\n",

        "\n",
        "- Upload a zip file called \"proteins.zip\" containing all the PDB files of the structures you want to run predictions for.\n",
        "  - Click the folder icon on the left hand side of the page\n",
        "  - Right click in the panel that opens up, and click the \"Upload\" option\n",
        "  - Browse to and select the zip file you created in the dialog that appears\n",
        "- Once this file is uploaded, in the \"Runtime\" menu at the top of the page, click \"Run all\"\n",
        "- A number of dependencies need to be downloaded and installed for the prediction to run - this can take a few minutes, so be patient.\n",
        "- When the predictions are done, a dialog window will appear with the results in a zip file - you can open or save this to your computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inside the results file are: \n",
        "- the predicted CD spectrum for each structure - if any of the PDB files you uploaded had multiple models a spectrum will have ben produced for each model.\n",
        "- The average CD spectrum of all uploaded structures\n",
        "- A log file containing information on the run, including the identities of any structures that failed during the prediction process\n"
